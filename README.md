## About the App

Welcome to Petter App! The useful app that helps you keep your household of pets organized and up-to-date. Pet owners all know how difficult it can be to keep tabs on every aspect of owning a pet. It's even more difficult when your pet can't tell you the last time they were fed or if they're due for their bordatella vaccine this month or next! Petter takes the guess wrok out of keeping your pet healthy and happy. With the ability to store the basic information like their birthday and microchip information and more complex information like medicatins, dosages, frequencies, and verterinarian information, Petter does it all.
